// Assume that a master file contains two fields, roll number and name of the student.
// At the end of the year, a set of students join the class and another set leaves. 
// A transaction file contains the roll numbers and an appropriate code to add or delete a student.

// Write a program to create another file that contains the updated list of names and roll number.
// Assume that the Master file and the transation files are arranged in ascending order by roll numbers.
// The updated file should also be in ascending order by roll numbers.
